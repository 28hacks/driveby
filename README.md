With only one tap DriveBy starts telling you the most interesting facts about the places you pass by. Completly hands-free you can get entertaining info about cities, architecture, nature and much more. Powered with the vast knowledge of Wikipedia you will never hear the same fact twice! You can even use it in public transport or just for a stroll around a new city. Enough words - just try it yourself!
